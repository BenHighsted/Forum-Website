# Forum-Website
I am creating a PHP website that will be a basic forum website as a way to practice using PHP.

I am planning to use a MAMP stack (MacOS, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to develop this website.

So far I have created a login system, the next step is to create a table to hold all the posts that will be created. Thinking it will have to be in this format:
	| id | topic | parent_post | user | content | timestamp |
